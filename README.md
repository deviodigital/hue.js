### :+1: CONTRIBUTING

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

### :warning: WARNING

Please don't edit files in the `dist` subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the `src` subdirectory!

While grunt can run the included unit tests via PhantomJS, this shouldn't be considered a substitute for the real thing. Please be sure to test the `test/*.html` unit test file(s) in _actual_ browsers.

### :memo: INSTALL GRUNT

_This assumes you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) installed already._

1. Test that grunt is installed globally by running `grunt --version` at the command-line.
2. If grunt isn't installed globally, run `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install the latest version. _You may need to run `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`._
3. From the root directory of this project, run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
